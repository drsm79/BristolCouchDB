            <h3>The Anthropological Significance of CouchDB</h3>
            <h5><a href="http://twitter.com/jez0990">Jeremy</a></h5>
            <p>I really did do some crazy stuff with CouchDB. I want to demonstrate a novel abstraction I've built
            and explain how we must use it to trigger a technological paradigm shift.<br/>
            Up until the 29th I will be posting <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/remap-couchdb"><b>here</b></a>
            and would love to get some early feedback :D

            <h3>Abusing CouchDB for fun and non-profits</h3>
 	 
            <h5><a href="http://twitter.com/m1ke_wallace">Mike Wallace</a><br/>Bristol University</h5>
            <p>This talk will provide a brief overview of how CouchDB can be
             used as a workflow and data management system for scientific
 	          simulation/modelling software before launching into a live demo
 	          where stochastic landslide simulations will be triggered from
 	          CouchDB and run in parallel on Amazon EC2 infrastructure.</p>
 	 
            <p>Along the way I'll be discussing various pain points that have
            been encountered, approaches to working around them, and things
 	          you can do when the successful operation of your system is
 	          analogous to surviving a distributed denial-of-service attack.</p>
