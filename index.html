            <h3>Completing the CouchDB command line jigsaw with jq</h3>
            <h5>Mike Wallace<br/><strong>
              <a href="https://cloudant.com">Cloudant</a></strong>
            </h5>
            <p>This talk introduces
              <a href="http://stedolan.github.com/jq/">jq</a>, a command line
              tool for processing JSON data. The talk will provide an overview
              of CouchDB tooling on the command line, discuss the key features
              of jq and conclude with some live demonstrations and examples.

              <a href="http://secondsync.com/">SecondSync</a></strong>
            </h5>
            <p>The SecondSync data platform has gone through through multiple
              architecture iterations over the past year. Find out how CouchDB
              helped us, why we had to leave it behind, and how it may yet
              become the prodigal database.
